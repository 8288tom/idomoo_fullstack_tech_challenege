# idomoo_fullstack_tech_challenege

This repository is a my challenge solution for the Full stack developer task by Idomoo.

The task is as follows:

Use the technology stack of your choice for the frontend part, node.js for the backend.
Use stackblitz , codesandbox or any similar service for deployment and working solution demonstration.
Create a fullstack web application that generates a video according to the data that the

end user enters in a form, including uploading image. The video should be played on an Idomoo 2.0 player embedded into a landing page.
Use Idomoo Generate API v3 that consists of two main APIs:

1. Metadata API: allowing to enquire about scenes, storyboards, accounts. 2. Generate API: allowing to generate a video by using either a pre-made
   storyboard or by editing scenes together on-the-fly. Example can be found at:
   https://pv.idomoo.com/index.php#/api/15289/Travel%20 proposal%20 demo%20G2
   Steps
1. As each video contains data drives elements first retrieve the needed elements by using storyboard metadata API.
   Use this to get a list of all the parameters in this storyboard. GET /storyboards/{storyboradId}
   Note that elements can be text or images
1. Build the form accordingly
1. Check if the video is ready using the check status URL, as described
1. Display the video using Idomoâ€™s player 2.0 Documentation can be found here
